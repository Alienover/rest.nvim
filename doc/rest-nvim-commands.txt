 run {scope?}                    Execute one or several HTTP requests depending
                                 on given `scope`. This scope can be either `last`,
                                 `cursor` (default) or `document`.

 last                            Re-run the last executed request, alias to `run last`
                                 to retain backwards compatibility with the old keybinds
                                 layout.

 logs                            Open the rest.nvim logs file in a new tab.

 env {action?} {path?}           Manage the environment file that is currently in use while
                                 running requests. If you choose to `set` the environment,
                                 you must provide a `path` to the environment file. The
                                 default action is `show`, which displays the current
                                 environment file path.

 result {direction?}             Cycle through the results buffer winbar panes. The cycle
                                 direction can be either `next` or `prev`.
